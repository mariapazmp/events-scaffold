# 6 Months before your event

For small/medium community events, you can start planning for the following semester:

## Open a roller speaker application for meetups.

Its a form that people can access from a link in landing pages and social media of the community. It's always open. Also, everytime you run an event, it's a good idea to promote. *"If you enjoyed this event and you want to be speaker, go to this link..."*

Additionally, you can offer a mentorship in the case people haven't developed skills as speakers can still participate.
Don't forget to ask for availability: "Which months are you available to give a speak?"
You can see an example of this type of form

## Be active on social media.
Depending on the necessities of your community, there's a social media strategy. 
Some organizers are very visible online and they share events of the community. Or new social media accounts can be created in the name of the community.
But its good to keep things moving between events.

## Venues and snacks.
If you run live events, identify in your city which spaces can host one of them. Coworking spaces, startup hubs, universities and companies can be your allies. Get in hand who's going to be your contact per venue (name, email...).

## Code of Conduct.
Create or inherit one from a related community. This applies for online and live events, small meetups or bigger conferences. As a complement, is good to have a privacy policy for the information you get from attendees.
